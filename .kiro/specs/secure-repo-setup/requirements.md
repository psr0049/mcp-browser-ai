# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves securely preparing the MCP browser automation project for public GitHub repository by creating proper .gitignore files, removing/replacing sensitive credentials, and safely pushing the code to the target repository.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a comprehensive .gitignore file, so that sensitive files and unnecessary artifacts are not committed to the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL include common Node.js patterns (node_modules, npm-debug.log, etc.)
2. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL exclude environment files (.env, .env.local, etc.)
3. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL exclude IDE-specific files (.vscode, .idea, etc.)
4. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL exclude OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc.)
5. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL exclude build artifacts and temporary files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to remove all sensitive credentials from configuration files, so that no API keys or secrets are exposed in the public repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning configuration files THEN the system SHALL identify all API keys and sensitive data
2. WHEN found credentials THEN the system SHALL replace actual values with placeholder variables
3. WHEN updating .env files THEN the system SHALL use template format with placeholder values
4. WHEN updating MCP config files THEN the system SHALL use environment variable references
5. WHEN credentials are found THEN the system SHALL create a secure .env.template file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely initialize and push the repository to GitHub, so that the code is version controlled and publicly accessible without security risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing git THEN the system SHALL create a new git repository if none exists
2. WHEN adding files THEN the system SHALL respect .gitignore patterns
3. WHEN committing THEN the system SHALL use descriptive commit messages
4. WHEN pushing THEN the system SHALL set the correct remote origin URL
5. WHEN pushing THEN the system SHALL verify no sensitive data is included in the commit

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to update documentation to reflect the security changes, so that users understand how to properly configure the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating README THEN the system SHALL document the .env.template usage
2. WHEN updating README THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
3. WHEN updating README THEN the system SHALL include security best practices
4. WHEN updating README THEN the system SHALL remove any embedded credentials from examples
